        	in summary, this means that:<br>
		- you have the right to see the source code<br>
		- you have the right to modify it<br>
		- you have the right to freely distribute<br>
		<br>
		under the following terms:<br>
		- all derivatives (like mods or forks) are also published under the AGPL v3.0<br>
		- the works are provided without warranty (basically i'm not responsible if it breaks)<br>
		- if the implementation is over a network (e.g. a webapp) then that is considered a distibution (so the AGPL v3.0 still applies)<br>
